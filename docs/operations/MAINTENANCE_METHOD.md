# Maintenance Method

This is the required operating method for maintaining Codex-Skills and AiCoding.

## Authority Chain

Agents must follow this order:

```text
AGENTS.md
-> maintenance Skill
-> docs
-> config and scripts
-> CI and Git hooks
```

Meaning:

1. `AGENTS.md` and nested `AGENTS.md` files define non-negotiable boundaries.
2. The maintenance Skill defines task workflow and mode gates.
3. Docs explain architecture and rationale.
4. `config/` and retained scripts define executable specialty surfaces.
5. CI, Git hooks, and local verification decide whether work can be considered complete.

The overall architecture authority is:

```text
docs/architecture/AICODING_CORE_ARCHITECTURE.md
```

Architecture work must deepen the stable kernel or add a governed capability adapter.
It must not create a second root resolver, registry loader, runner, report authority,
lifecycle, test engine, state store, or versioned implementation path.

## Maintenance Skill

The canonical maintenance workflow is maintained in Codex-Skills:

```text
platform/aicoding-kit-maintenance/SKILL.md
```

When packaged, it is exposed by the AiCoding plugin as:

```text
aicoding-kit-maintenance
```

Use that Skill for architecture changes, plugin packaging, submodule updates, install/update scripts, CodingKit assets, hooks, CI gates, and repository maintenance.

## Standard Modes

### Codex-Skills Source Or Plugin Change

```text
read AGENTS
-> modify canonical source
-> build plugin when bundled
-> compare generated output
-> verify plugin
-> verify skills
-> update docs and CHANGELOG
-> commit Codex-Skills
```

### AiCoding Platform Change

```text
read AGENTS
-> inspect config, Go CLI, docs, and retained scripts
-> modify AiCoding-owned files only
-> verify through Go-native default gates
-> run explicit PowerShell specialty checks only when the changed surface requires them
-> update docs and CHANGELOG
-> commit AiCoding
```

### Cross-Repository Upgrade

```text
verify and commit Codex-Skills
-> update AiCoding submodule to that commit
-> verify AiCoding
-> refresh installed plugin through Marketplace
-> review hooks when changed
```

AiCoding must not point to uncommitted Codex-Skills files.

## Required Checks

For AiCoding changes, use the Go CLI as the default control plane:

```powershell
go test ./...
go run ./cmd/aicoding bootstrap --json
go build -o bin/aicoding.exe ./cmd/aicoding
bin/aicoding.exe doctor --all --json
bin/aicoding.exe verify --profile Smoke --json
bin/aicoding.exe governance dependencies --json
bin/aicoding.exe doctor pwsh --json
bin/aicoding.exe doctor pwsh-budget --json
bin/aicoding.exe skill c99-standard-c status --json
bin/aicoding.exe docsync ci --json
bin/aicoding.exe skill verify --all --profile Smoke --json
bin/aicoding.exe lifecycle plan --action install --scope kit --all --json
bin/aicoding.exe test --profile Release --json
git diff --check
```

For publication, run only Release: it is a strict superset of Full on the current 73-leaf
registry. The leaf-by-leaf profile, Severity, and executed-Command evidence is recorded in
[TODO 0041](../todolist/done/0041-release-only-publication.md). Full remains available as an
independent development-iteration profile.

Run `bin/aicoding.exe docsync all --json` or `bin/aicoding.exe docsync release --json` when a change specifically touches DocSync policy or release documentation.

PowerShell checks are explicit specialty gates. Keep them for tag planning, release overlay compatibility, PowerShell quality, Plan Mode, external skill workflows, safety, hardware/toolchain diagnostics, and Codex-Skills source/plugin work.

Plan Mode 的路径触发权威是 Go CLI `plan check --staged` 与 `config/plan-policy.json`。
TODO 0004 阶段 pre-commit 仅告警；PowerShell `plan-mode-gate.ps1` 是兼容薄壳，不再拥有
敏感路径 pattern 或启动第二个验证流程。

For Codex-Skills changes, run the source repository gates in the Codex-Skills repository:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File CodingKit/agents/skills/scripts/build-plugin.ps1 -Plugin AiCoding -Configuration Development -Clean -Verify
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File CodingKit/agents/skills/scripts/compare-generated.ps1
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File CodingKit/agents/skills/scripts/verify-plugin.ps1
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File CodingKit/agents/skills/scripts/verify-skills.ps1
git diff --check
```

## Skill Authoring Boundary

Keep the system `skill-creator` installed for the built-in Codex skill authoring guidance.

The user-maintained workflow is named `aicoding-user-skill-creator` and displayed as `User-Skill-Creator`. It belongs to the AiCoding kit and must not reuse the runtime name `skill-creator`.

When a task is about creating or validating AiCoding/user-maintained skills, use `aicoding-user-skill-creator`. When a task is about generic system guidance and no AiCoding-specific workflow is needed, the system `skill-creator` remains available.

## Runtime Skill Exposure Audit

The source repository, user-level standalone skills, and installed plugin cache are separate runtime layers:

```text
Codex-Skills source repository
-> not a Skill Root
%USERPROFILE%\.agents\skills
-> selected standalone personal Skill links only
AiCoding Plugin cache
-> bundled aicoding-* runtime Skills
```

Before changing runtime exposure, use the current audit/profile entrypoints:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/specialty/audit-runtime-skills.ps1 -ExpectedProfile full -StandaloneRoot agents -Json
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/specialty/set-codex-skill-profile.ps1 -Profile full -StandaloneRoot agents -DryRun -Json
```

The audit enumerates direct Skill directories in both user roots so Windows junctions are not skipped. By default it inspects only the installed AiCoding plugin cache and compares its `BUILDINFO.json` with the released package; `-IncludeAllPluginCaches` is an explicit forensic mode, not an active-plugin inventory.

`standaloneSkillRegistry.skills` is the complete source catalog, not the default installation set. `profiles.full.standaloneSkills` is the explicit runtime allowlist. Applying either `runtime` or `full` removes registered paths that the selected profile does not expose from both supported user roots; unmanaged paths require `-MigrateUnmanaged` and are moved to the rollback backup before replacement or removal.

The `full` profile exposes all 25 published Matt Pocock engineering/productivity Skills from the Codex-Skills binding manifest, alongside the existing local standalone Skills and drawio-skill. It excludes upstream `misc` and `in-progress` directories. Review upstream stable-tag updates in Codex-Skills first; when the pinned release and bindings already match, only runtime profile synchronization is needed:

```powershell
bin/aicoding.exe lifecycle plan --action update --scope runtime-skill --runtime-profile full --standalone-root agents --json
bin/aicoding.exe lifecycle update --scope runtime-skill --runtime-profile full --standalone-root agents --json
bin/aicoding.exe lifecycle verify --scope runtime-skill --runtime-profile full --standalone-root agents --json
```

To converge registered standalone Skills on the canonical root, review the dry-run and then use:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/specialty/set-codex-skill-profile.ps1 -Profile full -StandaloneRoot agents -MigrateUnmanaged -Json
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/specialty/audit-runtime-skills.ps1 -ExpectedProfile full -StandaloneRoot agents -Strict -Json
```

`-MigrateUnmanaged` moves only registered paths under the two approved Skill roots, stores them under `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\backups\aicoding-skill-profiles`, and writes `rollback.json`. Without that switch, an unmanaged or mismatched path blocks the operation before mutation.

For plugin package drift, first run `lifecycle plan`. The apply path uses Codex `plugin remove/add`, verifies the installed build metadata, and only then updates AiCoding install state. If the Codex CLI cannot execute, the result is `manual-required` and includes the supported command and local-plugin deep link; cache files are never edited directly.

Do not move or delete user-level skill roots without a dry-run report, runtime audit, plugin verification, rollback plan, and user approval.

## Completion Rule

Do not claim completion if:

- a required gate failed;
- generated plugin output has unexplained drift;
- the submodule is dirty;
- AiCoding changed Skill source;
- a lower-layer Kit, Skill, MCP or module observes an upper-layer namespace or encodes its version into a stable identity;
- docs or CHANGELOG no longer match behavior;
- DocSync modes, semantic policy, or the single `bin/aicoding.exe docsync` entrypoint are missing or fail status/verify/test checks;
- Hook changes have not been reported for `/hooks` review;
- destructive Git or cache actions were needed but not explicitly authorized.
